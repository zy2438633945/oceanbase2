**OceanBase Database** is a distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Ant Group. The OceanBase Database is built on a common server cluster. Based on the [Paxos](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf)¬†protocol and its distributed structure, the OceanBase Database provides high availability and linear scalability. The OceanBase Database is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.

# Key features

- **Transparent Scalability**

    An OceanBase cluster can be scaled to 1,500 nodes transparently, handling petabytes of data and a trillion rows of records.

- **Ultra-fast Performance**

    The only distributed database that has refreshed both the TPC-C record, at 707 million tmpC, and the TPC-H record, at 15.26 million QphH @30000GB.

- **Real-time Operational Analytics**

    A unified system for both transactional and real-time operational analytics workloads.

- **Continuous Availability**

    OceanBase Database adopts the Paxos Consensus algorithm to achieve Zero RPO and less than 8 seconds of RTO. Supports intra-city/remote disaster recovery, enabling multi-activity in multiple locations and zero data loss.

- **MySQL Compatible**

    OceanBase Database is highly compatible with MySQL, which ensures that zero or a few modifications are needed for migration.

- **Cost Efficiency**

    The cutting-edge compression technology saves 70%‚Äì90% of storage costs without compromising performance. The multi-tenancy architecture achieves higher resource utilization.

# Quick start

## üî• Start with all-in-one

You can quickly deploy a stand-alone OceanBase Database to experience with the following commands:

**Note**: Linux Only

```shell
# download and install all-in-one package (internet connection is required)
bash -c "$(curl -s https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/download-center/opensource/oceanbase-all-in-one/installer.sh)"
source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh

# quickly deploy OceanBase database
obd demo
```

## üê≥ Start with docker

1. Start an OceanBase Database instance:

    ```shell
    # Deploy a mini standalone instance.
    docker run -p 2881:2881 --name oceanbase-ce -e MODE=mini -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce
    ```

2. Connect to the OceanBase Database instance:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it oceanbase-ce ob-mysql sys # Connect to the root user of the sys tenant.
    ```
