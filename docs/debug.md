# Abstract

This document describes some methods to debug OceanBase. We have many ways to debug OceanBase, such as gdb, logging, etc.

We suggest you build OceanBase with debug mode as it is easy to debug.

# GDB
GDB is a powerful debugging tool, but it is difficult to debug OceanBase by gdb and the scenarios are limited.

If you want to debug a single oceanbase process and single thread, you can use gdb, otherwise it is more recommended to use logging.

I suppose that you have already deployed the oceanbase built by source code.

Debugging oceanbase is similar to debugging other C++ programs, you can use gdb as the following:

1. find the process id
```bash
ps -ef | grep observer
```

or
```bash
pidof observer
```

2. attach the process
```bash
gdb observer <pid>
```

Then you can set breakpoint, print variable, etc. Please refer to [gdb manual](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/) for more information.

## Debug oceanbase with debug-info package
If you want to debug oceanbase or check the coredump file deployed with oceanbase rpm, you should install or load the debug-info package first. Loading is more recommended although installation is more convenient as there will be many debug-info packages in the system and it is not easy to cleanup.

First, obtain the debug-info package from the website, and then load the package into gdb. Afterward, you will be able to debug OceanBase with ease.

Below are some tips.

**How to find debug-info package**

You can get the package revision by the command below.
```bash
# in the observer runtime path
clusters/local/bin [83] $ ./observer -V
./observer -V
observer (OceanBase_CE 4.1.0.1)

REVISION: 102000042023061314-43bca414d5065272a730c92a645c3e25768c1d05
BUILD_BRANCH: HEAD
BUILD_TIME: Jun 13 2023 14:26:23
BUILD_FLAGS: RelWithDebInfo
BUILD_INFO:

Copyright (c) 2011-2022 OceanBase Inc.
```

If you see the error below
```
./observer -V
./observer: error while loading shared libraries: libmariadb.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

You can run command below to get the revision
```bash
clusters/local/bin [83] $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./observer -V
./observer -V
observer (OceanBase_CE 4.1.0.1)

REVISION: 102000042023061314-43bca414d5065272a730c92a645c3e25768c1d05
BUILD_BRANCH: HEAD
BUILD_TIME: Jun 13 2023 14:26:23
BUILD_FLAGS: RelWithDebInfo
BUILD_INFO:

Copyright (c) 2011-2022 OceanBase Inc.
```

**Download debug-info package**

From the version information above, we can get the first field of the revision. That is
```
REVISION: 102000042023061314-43bca414d5065272a730c92a645c3e25768c1d05
```
We need `102000042023061314`.

Then we search `102000042023061314` on the oceanbase rpm website like below.

![download debug info package](images/download-debug-info-package.png)

Here is a rpm website list.
- [x86_64 for el7](http://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/x86_64/)
- [x86_64 for el8](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/8/x86_64/)
- [aarch64(arm) for el7](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/aarch64/)
- [aarch64(arm) for el8](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/8/aarch64/)

**Extract debug-info package from rpm**

Extract debug-info package from rpm, for example.
```bash
rpm2cpio oceanbase-ce-debuginfo-4.1.0.1-102000042023061314.el7.x86_64.rpm | cpio -div
```

Then you can get this.
```bash
~/tmp/debug-info [83] $ tree -a
.
└── usr
    └── lib
        └── debug
            ├── .build-id
            │   └── ee
            │       ├── f87ee72d228069aab083d8e6d2fa2fcb5c03f2 -> ../../../../../home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer
            │       └── f87ee72d228069aab083d8e6d2fa2fcb5c03f2.debug -> ../../home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer.debug
            └── home
                └── admin
                    └── oceanbase
                        └── bin
                            └── observer.debug
```

`observer.debug` is the debug-info package we need and `f87ee72d228069aab083d8e6d2fa2fcb5c03f2.debug` is a symbolic link.

**Debug oceanbase with debug-info package**

Now, you can attach a process or a coredump file with gdb with commands below.
```bash
# attach a process
gdb ./observer `pidof observer`
```

or

```bash
# open a coredump file
gdb ./observer <coredump file name>
```

Usually, you will get this message.

```
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...
Reading symbols from clusters/local/bin/observer...
(No debugging symbols found in clusters/local/bin/observer)
Attaching to program: clusters/local/bin/observer, process 57296
```

This means that there are no debugging symbols.

If we run some debug command in gdb, such as `bt`, we could get this.

```bash
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007fb6e9c36d62 in pthread_cond_timedwait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0
#1  0x00007fb6f9f44862 in ob_pthread_cond_timedwait ()
#2  0x00007fb6eee8d206 in oceanbase::common::ObThreadCond::wait_us(unsigned long) ()
#3  0x00007fb6f34b21c8 in oceanbase::observer::ObUniqTaskQueue<oceanbase::observer::ObServerSchemaTask, oceanbase::observer::ObServerSchemaUpdater>::run1() ()
#4  0x00007fb6f9f44259 in oceanbase::lib::Threads::run(long) ()
#5  0x00007fb6f9f40aca in oceanbase::lib::Thread::__th_start(void*) ()
```

We cannot get the source code file name or function parameters information.

Let's load the debug-info package.

```bash
(gdb) symbol-file usr/lib/debug/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer.debug
Reading symbols from usr/lib/debug/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer.debug...
```

> It's better to use the full path of the debug info file.

Let's run the debug command again and we can get detailed information.

```bash
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007fb6e9c36d62 in pthread_cond_timedwait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0

```

# Logging
Logging is the most common way to debug OceanBase, and it is easy to use and can be used in most scenarios.
In common scenarios, we can add logs in the code and print the variable, then rebuild and redeploy the oceanbase.

## How to add logs
You can prefer the logging code in the source code, such as 
```cpp
LOG_DEBUG("insert sql generated", K(insert_sql));
```

Here `LOG_DEBUG` is a macro to print log in debug level.

You can see that it is a little different from other programs. The first parameter is a string, and the other parameters are usually K(variable_name). `K` is a macro to print the variable name and value.

## How to search logs
The logs are stored in the log directory which is under the `home_path` directory. You can search the logs by `grep` command.

Below is a log example:
```
[2023-07-05 16:40:42.635136] INFO  [SQL.EXE] explicit_start_trans (ob_sql_trans_control.cpp:194) [88022][T1003_ArbSer][T1003][YD9F97F000001-0005FFB71FCF95C7-0-0] [lt=42] start_trans(ret=0, tx_id={txid:2118151}, session={this:0x7ff2663d6188, id:1, tenant:"sys", tenant_id:1, effective_tenant:"sys", effective_tenant_id:1003, database:"oceanbase", user:"root@%", consistency_level:3, session_state:0, autocommit:true, tx:0x7ff26b0e4300}, read_only=false, ctx.get_execution_id()=18446744073709551615)
```

You can see the timestamp(`[2023-07-05 16:40:42.635136]`), log level(`INFO`), module name(`[SQL.EXE]`), function name(`explicit_start_trans`), file(`ob_sql_trans_control.cpp`), line number(`194`), thread id(`88022`), thread name(`T1003_ArbSer`), trace id(`YD9F97F000001-0005FFB71FCF95C7-0-0`), etc.

The `trace id` is a unique id for each SQL request. You can search a specific trace id to find all logs about this SQL request.

## Tips with logging
**Trace ID**

You can use the SQL command below to get the trace id of the last SQL request.
```sql
select last_trace_id();
```
**Log Level**

You can use the SQL command below to adjust the log level dynamically.
```sql
set ob_log_level=debug;
```
**Log Traffic Control**

If you can not find your log, it may be limited because of the log traffic control, you can use the SQL command below to change the behavior of the log traffic control.
```sql
alter system set syslog_io_bandwidth_limit='1G';
alter system set diag_syslog_per_error_limit=1000;
```
**Print Log Synchronously**

You can use SQL command below to print log synchronously.
```sql
alter system set enable_async_syslog='False';
```
**Print Call Stack**

You can print the call stack information in the log, such as:
```cpp
LOG_DEBUG("insert sql generated", K(insert_sql), K(lbt()));
```
You may got this:
```txt
lbt()="0x14371609 0xe4ce783 0x54fd9b6 0x54ebb1b 0x905e62e 0x92a4dc8 0x905df11 0x905dc94 0x13d2278e 0x13d22be3 0x6b10b81 0x6b0f0f7 0x62e2491 0x10ff6409 0x1475f87a 0x10ff6428 0x1475f1c2 0x1476ba83 0x14767fb5 0x14767ae8 0x7ff340250e25 0x7ff33fd0ff1d"
```

Then you can use the command below to get the call stack information:
```bash
addr2line -pCfe ./bin/observer 0x14371609 0xe4ce783 0x54fd9b6 0x54ebb1b 0x905e62e 0x92a4dc8 0x905df11 0x905dc94 0x13d2278e 0x13d22be3 0x6b10b81 0x6b0f0f7 0x62e2491 0x10ff6409 0x1475f87a 0x10ff6428 0x1475f1c2 0x1476ba83 0x14767fb5 0x14767ae8 0x7ff340250e25 0x7ff33fd0ff1d
```

I got this:

# SQL
You can get some debug information by SQL command. First run the command below to enable the trace:
```sql
-- on 4.x
set ob_enable_show_trace=1;
```

And then run a SQL command, such as:
```sql
select * from t, t1 where t.id=t1.id;
```

After that, you can run the command below to get the trace information:
```sql
show trace;
```

You may got this:

# Debug Sync

If you use gdb to debug OceanBase, it maybe cannot work normally because gdb will hang the process and OceanBase depends on the heartbeat to work normally. So we provide a debug sync mechanism to solve this problem.

The specific thread of OceanBase process will hang on the point if you add a debug sync point in the code, and then you can do something to debug the process, such as attach the process by gdb, or execute some SQL commands to get some information.

> Debug Sync can work on release mode, so it is enabled on production environment.

## How to use

**Add a debug sync definition in the code**

You can open the file `ob_debug_sync_point.h` and append your debug sync definition in the macro `OB_DEBUG_SYNC_POINT_DEF`. For example:
```cpp
#define OB_DEBUG_SYNC_POINT_DEF(ACT)                               \
    ACT(INVALID_DEBUG_SYNC_POINT, = 0)                             \
    ACT(NOW,)                                                      \
    ACT(MAJOR_FREEZE_BEFORE_SYS_COORDINATE_COMMIT,)                \
    ACT(BEFORE_REBALANCE_TASK_EXECUTE,)                            \
    ACT(REBALANCE_TASK_MGR_BEFORE_EXECUTE_OVER,)                   \
    ACT(UNIT_BALANCE_BEFORE_PARTITION_BALANCE,)
```

**Add a debug sync point in the code**

If you want debug some functions, then add your debug sync point there. For example:

```cpp
int ObRootService::do_restart()
{
  int ret = OB_SUCCESS;

  const int64_t tenant_id = OB_SYS_TENANT_ID;
  SpinWLockGuard rs_list_guard(broadcast_rs_list_lock_);
  ...
  DEBUG_SYNC(BEFORE_UNIT_MANAGER_LOAD);
  ...
}
```

You can put the same debug sync point anywhere you want.

**Enable Debug Sync**

Debug sync is disabled by default, you can enable it by the SQL command below:
```sql
alter system set debug_sync_timeout='100000s';
```

The debug sync will be enabled if `debug_sync_timeout` larger than 0.

> NOTE: the unit of `debug_sync_timeout` is microsecond.

**Enable your debug sync point**

You can enable your debug sync point by the SQL command below:
```sql
set ob_global_debug_sync = 'BEFORE_UNIT_MANAGER_LOAD wait_for signal_name execute 10000';
```

`execute` means the debug sync action will be disabled after 10000 execution.

`signal_name` is the name to wakeup.

The specific thread will hang on the debug sync point when it executes the debug sync point and then you can do something to debug the process.

**Signal the debug sync point**

You can signal the debug sync point by the SQL command below:
```sql
set ob_global_debug_sync = 'now signal signal_name';
-- or
set ob_global_debug_sync = 'now broadcast signal_name';
```
`signal_name` is the name you set when you enable the debug sync point.

And then the specific thread will continue to execute.

**Clear your debug sync point**

You should clear your debug sync point after you debug the process, you can clear it by the SQL command below:
```sql
set ob_global_debug_sync = 'BEFORE_UNIT_MANAGER_LOAD clear';
```

**Disable debug sync**

You can disable debug sync by the SQL command below:
```sql
alter system set debug_sync_timeout=0;
```

## How debug sync works
The process will use `condition_variable` to wait for the signal when it executes the debug sync point, and then it will hang on the debug sync point. The process will continue to execute after it receives the signal.

If you want to know more about the debug sync mechanism, you can refer to the code in `ob_debug_sync.cpp/.h`.
