###common
delete from t1 where c2 > 10 order by c1 limit 0, 1
delete from t1 where c1 = 1

###where
delete from t1 partition(p0) where c1 = 1

#### question mark
delete from t1 where 2 = 1
delete from t1 where c1 = 0
delete from t1 where 1 = 1


### order by
#### asc, desc
delete from t2 order by c1, c2 desc, c3 asc

#### function or expression
delete from t2 order by c2/2
delete from t1 order by 1+1

#delete from t1 order by 1	//not support

### limit

#### const
delete from t1 limit 10
delete from t1 limit 2, 10
delete from t1 limit 2 offset 10

#### question mark
delete from t1 limit 1
delete from t1 limit 1,0
delete from t1 limit 2,10
delete from t1 limit 1,10

### hintkkk
delete /*+ INDEX(t1 idx1)*/ from t1 where c1 =1

### partition
delete from t1 partition (p1)

### multiple table
#delete from t1,t2 where t1.c1 = t2.c1 //not support

### not contain the index's rowkey
delete from test where c1 = 1
#test truncate
truncate table test;
truncate table t1;
drop database delete_db;
